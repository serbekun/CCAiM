# CCAiM – Cloud Classification AI Model

## 📌 Project Status

Currently in the dataset collection phase.

## 🎯 Project Goal

CCAiM aims to develop an AI-powered model for classifying clouds based on ground-level photographs.
The project uses image recognition techniques to identify cloud types according to the WMO International Cloud Atlas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cloud_Atlas) classification.

## ☁️ Target Cloud Classes

The model will be trained to recognize the following cloud types:
 1. Cirrus (Ci) – Thin, wispy clouds high in the sky.
 2. Cirrostratus (Cs) – Transparent, whitish veil clouds, often covering the whole sky.
 3. Cirrocumulus (Cc) – Small, white patches of clouds without shadows.
 4. Altostratus (As) – Gray or bluish clouds covering the sky, usually ahead of storms.
 5. Altocumulus (Ac) – White or gray clouds in layers or patches, often with shading.
 6. Stratus (St) – Uniform, gray clouds covering the entire sky.
 7. Stratocumulus (Sc) – Low, lumpy clouds, often in patches with blue sky visible.
 8. Nimbostratus (Ns) – Dark, thick clouds that bring continuous precipitation.
 9. Cumulus (Cu) – Fluffy, white clouds with flat bases.
 10. Cumulonimbus (Cb) – Towering clouds associated with thunderstorms.

## 🛠 Planned Features
 • 📷 Dataset expansion – using photographs taken by the project team and contributors.
 • 🧠 Multiple model versions:
 • V1 First model version be creted when so so mini data set was colletc.
 • 🔍 Image classification API for integration into other applications.
 • 🌐 Interactive web demo to test the model online.
 • 📊 Model evaluation tools for accuracy and performance metrics.
